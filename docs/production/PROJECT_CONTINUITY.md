# Pokémon Rojo Fuego Full v1.0 — Project Continuity

**Purpose:** make the repository sufficient to resume the project without relying on any previous chat.

## 1. Start here in every new session

Before modifying code:

1. Read this file.
2. Read `docs/production/DECISION_AMENDMENTS.md`.
3. Read `docs/production/RC_AUDIT_LOG.md`.
4. Read `docs/production/FINAL_AUDIT_PLAN.md`.
5. Read `docs/production/RC_MYBOY_CHECKLIST.md`.
6. Read `docs/production/SECOND_PASS_AUDIT.md`.
7. Inspect the current branch HEAD and latest GitHub Actions result.
8. Only if a design detail is still needed, consult the frozen sources under `docs/spec/`.

Previous chats are **not required** and must not override the repository.

## 2. Source-of-truth precedence

From highest to lowest authority:

1. Explicit approved post-freeze amendments in `docs/production/DECISION_AMENDMENTS.md`.
2. Frozen preproduction specification under `docs/spec/Pokemon_Rojo_Fuego_Full_Preproduccion_v1.0.md`.
3. Frozen matrices under `docs/spec/Pokemon_Rojo_Fuego_Full_Matrices_v1.0.md`.
4. Frozen decision log under `docs/spec/Pokemon_Rojo_Fuego_Full_Decision_Log_v1.0.md`.
5. Frozen production prompt under `docs/spec/Pokemon_Rojo_Fuego_Full_Prompt_Maestro_Produccion_v1.0.md`.
6. Current implementation and automated tests as evidence of what is actually implemented.

A historical frozen requirement superseded by an approved amendment must **not** be silently restored.

## 3. Approved amendments that materially change the freeze

- **A-001:** MyBoy is the required runtime QA emulator. mGBA is optional diagnostic only.
- **A-002:** abandon the 142-slot normal Items pocket; keep vanilla 42-slot behavior. The 400 bytes at `0x348C` remain reserved/unused.
- **A-003:** finish implementation/static verification first; concentrate user-run runtime QA in the final RC phase instead of stopping after every block.
- **A-004:** GitHub is the continuity authority. Chats are disposable.

## 4. Repository / branch / baseline

- Repository: `joseiturriaga25amz/pokefirered-europe`.
- Active production branch: `feature/full-gameplay-core`.
- Frozen vanilla tag: `baseline-spanish-vanilla`.
- Baseline commit: `e184c5cf898cd29efbd33bc1bfe5994277e21ab`.
- Production target: `firered_es_modern`.
- Baseline Spanish SHA-1: `ab8f6bfe0ccdaf41188cd015c8c74c314d02296a`.

## 5. Current technical state at continuity freeze

The first exhaustive static audit is nearly complete and an explicit **second-pass adversarial audit** is active.

Latest code-affecting second-pass commits include:

- `25fb95adfaab7c734d86f9e83241c4ae148d914b` — corrected wireless-status UBFIX applied from a clean pre-change file;
- `2f21644529ba1146f70adc8b7f26a7e3135a60e9` — applies Full Hall-of-Fame KO recovery to the Spanish script actually compiled;
- `74bf56b4ac6799682d2ccef60c274b0f80582a36` — restores the non-target generic Hall-of-Fame script to vanilla;
- `444b1f27e4bfda87f3f326937af238d7e28c0845` — extends exact audited blob locks to trainer payloads and target-language high-risk scripts;
- `7fe7204c8d125180dee1faa18df5309b599e8732` — adds the second-pass release-integrity validator to consolidated CI.

The exact current HEAD still requires a fresh consolidated CI result before any RC freeze. Older CI success and older ROM hashes are historical evidence only and must **not** be treated as validation of the current code payload.

The workflow still builds `firered_es_modern`, performs two clean builds and requires byte-for-byte reproducibility before recording a checksum.

## 6. RC audit findings repaired so far

See `RC_AUDIT_LOG.md` for the authoritative finding-by-finding record. The recovery/final audit now includes RC-F001..RC-F035, with RC-F031 explicitly corrected as a false positive rather than retained as a fictional bug fix.

Important late findings include:

- vanilla-save migration existed but was not called on Continue;
- reusable-TM capacity/add/shop paths were inconsistent;
- direct trade-evolution items reached the UI without a core evolution effect;
- doubles AI had per-side history aliasing and out-of-bounds move-history reads;
- Gary routing/identity still depended on vanilla starter branches;
- recorded AI hold effects were briefly reinterpreted as item IDs and corrected;
- tested link synchronization fixes were excluded from Full's MODERN revision-0 build;
- UBFIX mon-data accessors still relied on incompatible function aliases;
- wireless status group accounting could index outside its counter array;
- Hall-of-Fame state validation was checking a generic script while the Spanish target lacked the Full KO-recovery hooks;
- Repel RC-F031 was a recovery-audit false positive: the Spanish target already implemented QOL-007, and the generic accidental edit was reverted.

Exact blob locks now cover the original high-risk gameplay data plus trade, trainer metadata/parties and selected Spanish high-risk scripts.

## 7. Important automatic validators

### `tools/validate_full_trainer_sets.py`
Last known PASS:
- 34 Full parties;
- 163 Pokémon;
- 632 custom moves;
- validates species, level, IV, held item and move legality including level-up, TM/HM, tutor, egg and pre-evolution learnability.

### `tools/validate_release_integrity.py`
Second-pass meta-gate that verifies:
- consolidated CI targets `firered_es_modern`;
- all production validators are actually invoked;
- Gate 6/7/QoL checks point at Spanish scripts that feed the target;
- generic non-target Hall-of-Fame/Repel scripts remain vanilla;
- second-pass high-risk blob locks are present;
- audit-log traceability includes the corrected false positive and late recovery findings.

### `tools/validate_rc_freeze.py`
Protects, among other things:
- Gen III species/move/item ID-space compatibility;
- SaveBlock1 size and Full header offset;
- non-destructive Full save migration;
- vanilla bag reservation after A-002;
- frozen item and berry prices;
- EV-reducing berry definitions;
- Two Island berry progression;
- fossils and Cinnabar revival;
- second Fighting Dojo state/reward;
- approved evolution invariants;
- all nine Altering Cave tables/selector values;
- Porygon 5,000-coin price.

## 8. Save / compatibility facts

Direct comparison with `baseline-spanish-vanilla` established:

- vanilla had `unused_3D24[16]`;
- Full replaces exactly those 16 bytes with `struct FullSaveHeader`;
- `towerChallengeId` and `trainerTower` keep their offsets;
- `SaveBlock1` remains `0x3D68`;
- `fullHeader` remains at `0x3D24`;
- `unused_348C[400]` remains intact after A-002;
- Pokémon / BoxPokemon layouts remain compile-locked Gen III compatible;
- species/move/item ID spaces remain vanilla-sized;
- pre-National non-Kanto/egg link restrictions remain;
- Gen III Pokémon trading compatibility is an explicit acceptance goal;
- round-tripping the same modified save through vanilla is **not** a supported goal.

## Current RC audit recovery note

After the 2026-09-20 app-side forced closures, repository history was confirmed intact and the audit resumed from GitHub. The first audit found multiple real defects and also exposed one false positive caused by inspecting a generic language script instead of the Spanish file actually compiled. That false positive is recorded and corrected.

The audit is now using a second independent layer defined in `docs/production/SECOND_PASS_AUDIT.md`: compiled-target verification, semantic baseline diff, validator skepticism, negative-path review, cross-layer contradiction checks and exact blob locks after semantic review.

Current static work is close to completion, but **no RC is frozen yet**. Required next milestone: exact current HEAD must pass consolidated CI; only then may one reproducible ROM/checksum be frozen for the final MyBoy checklist.

## 9. What remains before v1.0 final

The project is no longer in a broad implementation phase. Remaining work is primarily **Release Candidate audit and runtime acceptance**:

1. finish exhaustive static/specification audit described in `FINAL_AUDIT_PLAN.md`;
2. ensure exact final HEAD CI is green;
3. build/freeze one RC ROM and record checksum;
4. execute `RC_MYBOY_CHECKLIST.md` on that exact build;
5. repair any runtime defects;
6. rerun affected tests plus adjacent regressions;
7. perform final release-diff and documentation consistency pass;
8. only then promote/merge/tag v1.0.

Do **not** call the project 100% final merely because CI is green.

## 10. Working-style instruction

The user explicitly prefers:

- rapid forward progress;
- autonomous, meticulous internal review;
- no repeated manual testing interruptions during implementation;
- runtime tests concentrated at meaningful final milestones;
- no need to request approval for ordinary bug fixes required to satisfy already-approved requirements.

Do not reintroduce a slow block-by-block approval workflow.

## 11. If a new chat starts

The correct first action is to inspect this repository and continue from the RC audit. Do not ask the user to reconstruct old chat history and do not assume a stale commit from a previous conversation is still HEAD.
