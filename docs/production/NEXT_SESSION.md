# Next Session — Pokémon Rojo Fuego Full v1.0

Resume from the repository, never from chat memory.

## Read first

1. `docs/production/PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md` — section 0 is the live resume point.
2. `docs/production/REPOSITORY_GUARDRAILS.md`.
3. `docs/production/DECISION_AMENDMENTS.md` — especially A-013.
4. `docs/production/POLISH_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md`.
5. Inspect live refs, exact HEADs and Full Gameplay Core evidence for the SHA being advanced.

Use `docs/spec/` only for frozen historical design details.

- Do **not** begin Lt. Surge yet; await explicit user direction.

## Exact next action

1. preserve Brock second-pass closure as the current completed roster-tuning state;
2. do not modify Lt. Surge or any other leader until the user explicitly resumes that pass;
3. if new Brock adjustments are requested, open a new scoped microblock rather than rewriting the closure history.

## Continuity rule

No new generic continuity/backlog/handoff file is needed. Project continuity lives here and in `PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md`; approved decisions live in `DECISION_AMENDMENTS.md`; the production work order lives in `POLISH_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md`.

MyBoy remains the required final runtime acceptance environment.
